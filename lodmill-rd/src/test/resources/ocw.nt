<http://oerworldmap.org/resource/ocw321> <http://schema.org/description> "Hanyang University took its first step as Dong-A Engineering Institute on July 1st, 1939. It was the period in which the Japanese were making frantic efforts in pursuing their extensive policies to liquidate all of Korean history and heritage and assimilate them into that of the Japanese. Baik Nam, Lyun Joon Kim, the founder of Hanyang University established Dong-A Institute based on the strong conviction that the education, specifically education in technology, would be the only way to restore Korea and to pave the way for the advancement of the nation. Under this belief, Dong-A institute started with 630 students and a faculty of 13 professors and 22 instructors in Jongno-gu, Seoul. After producing its first graduates in 1941, Dong-A tried to elevate itself to college status, with no avail. In May 1941, the Institute moved to where Pearson Biblical Seminary was located and offered education specializing in engineering and technology to 100 students who had finished secondary school. In 1943, still under Japanese occupation, the Institute was suspended from recruiting new students, which resulted in a temporary shut-down of the school on March 15, 1944, when the last 78 students graduated.  \r\nUpon the restoration of the nation's independence in August 1945, Dong-A Institute renamed itself the Engineering Institute for National Foundation and settled at 251 Shindang-dong, Seoul. Having fostered numerous engineers in the storm of upheaval since the nation's independence, Dr. Lyun Joon Kim, the founder, foresaw the importance of industrial advancement in the reconstruction of Korea, and contributed by establishing Hanyang as a judicial and academic body. The board of trustees at that time included Myowook Lee, Byeongok Cho, Kwansoo Baik, Wonchul Lee, Waljoon Kim, Taeyong Choi, and Lyunjoon Kim, who had led the nation's independence movement. Inspired by the strong support of the foundation, the Institute was upgraded to the nation's first four year Engineering College, being approved by the Ministry of Education of the Interim Government, and they elected Dr. Lyunjoon Kim as the first Dean. Six departments were set up including Electrical, Mechanical, and Civil Engineering, Architecture, Chemical, and Mining as well as an Engineering High School and a middle school.  \r\nAlthough during the Korean War, many of the schools facilities were destroyed and the professors and students were scattered all over classes were continued in Busan with temporary teachers. However, even during their refuge, the College fostered numerous competent science teachers by building a training center for secondary school teachers in the technical fields. In 1953, it was authorized as a graduate school by the Ministry of Education. The building was restored in Haengdang-dong, Seongdong-gu, Seoul and it is still the current address of Hanyang University.  \r\nHanyang University formed the university foundation in March, 1959 and Mr. Lyun-joon Kim was inaugurated as the first President. The University started with 19 departments in 3 colleges (the College of Engineering, the College of Liberal Arts and Science and the College of Politics and Economy) and 6 departments offering evening courses.  \r\nAs the University has expanded its size, the Colleges of Music, Physical Education and Education were newly established. By adding the College of Medicine, 46 departments of 7 colleges and 9 departments offering night courses were established. Hanyang University Medical Center was established in 1972 with Ansan Campus in the new industrial city near Seoul at the same time.  \r\nBased on such history and tradition, the University is trying to continually evolve itself in order to foster the competent leaders required in the 21st century. In 2001, the University set up HY Dream 2010, with the vision of becoming a cradle to foster leaders in the new millennium. The Plan has been implemented to be born again as HYU Project 2010. Based on this objective, all of Hanyang's community members are giving their best to accomplish the goal of nurturing Global i-leader.  \r\nHanyang University began as the nation's first private College of Engineering, producing numerous specialists who have worked as the backbone of the nation's industrialization and modernization. Now, it is arising as a new model of an educational System for the 21st century. Hanyangians treasure their history and traditions and are spreading their wings to design a better future. Celebrating its 67th anniversary, Hanyang University is setting its firm step towards advancing into one of the most prestigious universities of Korea and in the world." .

As a nation's highest educational institution, Old Sungkyunkwan went through vicissitudes with the country it served over the centuries. Though a long history alone cannot guarantee the excellence of an institution, the rich culture, which exudes from a long tradition, is surely a unique and valuable asset of the University. It would be misleading, however, to view the University merely in the context of its pre-modern history. \r\n\r\nWhat the University has achieved in the past fifty years meets and exceeds that of the preceding five hundred and fifty years. We take pride in the University's innovative spirit; as a result of the long efforts to place natural sciences on an equal footing with our strong foundation in humanities, we now operate two campuses: the Humanities and Social Sciences Campus and the Natural Sciences Campus. Based on a highly successful partnership with Samsung which has generously funded several core initiatives, the University has been rapidly developing and prospering since 1996." .

<http://oerworldmap.org/resource/ocw480> <http://schema.org/description> "NTU's institutional predecessor was Taihoku Imperial University, founded in 1928 by the Japanese colonial administration. The first president was Shidehara Tan Tairaka Hiroshi. In 1945, the Republic of China won the war of resistance against Japan, and Taiwan was handed over to the Nationalist government of China. On November 15 of that year, Taihoku Imperial University was formally transferred to Chinese administration and renamed as National Taiwan University, with Dr. Tsung-lo Lo appointed as the first President. \r\n\r\n      During the Japanese occupation, the University consisted of two academic divisions: the Literature and Politics division and the Science and Agriculture division, with about 60 students enrolled each semester. The Medical division was added in 1936, followed by the Engineering division in 1943. Additionally, the University included the affiliated Agriculture and Forestry division, the affiliated Medical special division, a Tropical Medicine research institute and a preparatory school. Also, in 1943 the Southern Humanities research institute and the Southern Resource research institute were added. At that time, each division operated according to the lecture system, with a full-time Professor in charge of a faculty of associate professors, lecturers, teaching assistants and staff. These divisions and institutes were financially independent and had their own libraries. By 1945, the university expanded to five divisions, including Literature and Politics, Science, Agriculture, Medicine and Engineering, with a total enrollment of 382 students. \r\n\r\n      After restructuring in accordance with the ROC academic system in 1945, academic departments were established and the former divisions were renamed Colleges. The Literature and Politics division was divided into the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Law. Additionally, colleges of Science, Medicine, Engineering and Agriculture were established. Initially, there were six colleges with 22 departments. In 1945, student enrollment was 585. In the following years, the departments and colleges expanded in faculty and hardware in step with growing budgets and rising social expectations. In 1960, the night school was initiated on a trial basis, and in 1967 a new night school was established. In 1987, the College of Management was established, followed by the College of Public Health in 1993 and the College of Electrical Engineering in 1997. The College of Electrical Engineering was later rechristened the College of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering; in 1999, the College of Law was renamed the College of Social Sciences, and the Night Division and the Center for Continuing Education were combined to form the School for Professional and Continuing Studies. In 2002, the College of Agriculture was renamed the College of Bio-resources and Agriculture, and in 2002 a College of Life Sciences was added. Now, the university has 11 colleges, with 54 departments and 103 graduate institutes, plus four university-level research centers: Population and Gender Studies Center, Center for Condensed Matter Sciences, Center for Biotechnology, and Bio-diversity Research Center. The total number of students, including those enrolled at the School of Professional and Continuing Studies, has grown to over 33,000, including over 17,000 university students and 15,000 graduate students. Now, the number of graduate students at NTU almost equals the number of university students, which indicates that NTU has successfully been transformed into a research university." .

It began as the Advanced Academy of Agronomy and Forestry, founded by the Japanese in Taipei in 1919. After 1928, the Academy became a special department affiliated to Taihoku Imperial University (now National Taiwan University). However, the department became an independent school again in 1943, and was moved to Taichung.\r\n\r\nAfter the Restoration of Taiwan in 1945, the school was reorganized and renamed Taiwan Provincial Taichung Agricultural Junior College. In 1946, the Junior College evolved into a higher institution, Taiwan Provincial College of Agriculture. Then in 1961, it combined with the newly-established College of Science and Engineering on the same Taichung campus and the College of Law and Business founded in Taipei in 1949, to become Taiwan Provincial Chung Hsing University. In 1964, an Evening School was set up on the Taipei Campus. In 1968 another Evening School and the College of Liberal Arts were added to the Taichung Campus. The University continued to grow in size, and in 1971 it became a national university, and assumed its present name: National Chung Hsing University (NCHU).\r\n\r\nThe College of Veterinary Medicine was established in September 1999. In February 2000, the Taipei Campus including the College of Law & Business and Taipei Evening School was combined into the newly established National Taipei University.

<http://oerworldmap.org/resource/ocw484> <http://schema.org/description> "National Dong Hwa University was founded in July 1994 with the planning stage started three years earlier. \r\n\r\nIn October 1991, the National Dong Hwa University Planning Office was established in Shoufeng, Hualien, by the Ministry of Education as part of its mission to foster the balanced regional development of Taiwan through the even distribution of higher education systems in the north, south, east and west of the island. Professor Paul Tzung-Tsan Mu was appointed to head the Office and led the development of plans for eastern Taiwan's first comprehensive university. \r\n\r\nOn July 1, 1994, National Dong Hwa University was formally inaugurated with Professor Mu serving as its founding President. After seven years of vigorous and unflagging commitment, Professor Mu resigned his administrative duties at the University in the summer of 2001. By then, National Dong Hwa University was established with four colleges, namely the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, the College of Sciences and Engineering, the College of Management, and the College of Indigenous Studies. \r\n\r\nThe College of Indigenous Studies was founded in August 2001. Being the first aboriginal school on ethnic studies in Taiwan, the College of Indigenous Studies was established with the mission of universalizing and internationalizing ethnicity issues, and serving as an epicenter for Taiwanese ethnic and Austronesian research. \r\n\r\nOn January 23, 2002, Professor Wen-Shu Hwang, who shared Professor Mu's mission of transforming a series of humble sugarcane fields into a distinguished university since the very beginning, was elected to serve as Professor Mu's successor. Under Professor Hwang's innovative leadership, the University continued to strive for excellent teaching, research and community outreach. \r\n\r\nIn 2004, the College of Marine Science was established in Pingtung as the fifth college of National Dong Hwa University. The establishment of the College was a pioneering act in Taiwan by combining the resources and expertise of a university and a prestigious museum, the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium." .

In 1979, we became a national institution, and were renamed the National Taiwan College of Marine Science and Technology. A decade later, in 1989, the college became a full-fledged university. \r\n\r\nAt present, NTOU has six colleges - Maritime Science and Management, Life Sciences, Ocean Science and Resource, Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, as well as Humanities and Social Sciences. These Colleges house a total of 28 undergraduate departments and graduate institutes. \r\n\r\nAs we look at the progress over the last 52 years, the University has undergone great growth and change and is now recognized as one of the nation's most important centers of learning and scholarship, especially in the marine sciences and maritime studies. \r\n\r\nResponding to the changing needs of society and the widening interests of our students, we are developing into a comprehensive university with a unique maritime focus. We aim to be an internationally known institution of higher education. Toward this end, our social sciences and liberal arts programs are developing as a core part of education at NTOU. The University is rapidly moving toward providing a positive learning environment and culture for intellectual and personal growth, with ocean interests as our unique characteristic." .

Many new facilities have been constructed on campus, such as laboratories, audio-visual classrooms, faculty research rooms, and discussion rooms to provide both students and faculty a positive environment to study and do research. \r\n\r\nOriginally, it was an industrial junior college, then afterwards it was changed to a junior college of industry and business. Due to its achievements in offering high quality education, of more than ten junior colleges the school was the first one of its kind to be promoted a college of technology, and then finally once again promoted to the status of a university of technology. The various stages of this transformation have closely kept up with the changes in the country's key stages of development that demand a pool of talented professionals. \r\n\r\nKun Shan has put emphasis on integrating school transportation, campus landscape and structures, department offices, regular classrooms and laboratories in order to provide a comfortable educational environment.

<http://oerworldmap.org/resource/ocw9> <http://schema.org/description> "Being the first institution in Latin America to create graduation courses in Public and Business Administration, FGV graduated in the middle of the 50's the first classes of business administration in the region, at the then existing Brazilian Public Administration School (formerly known as EBAP, currently EBAPE) and the Sao Paulo Business School (EAESP). Currently, these two units and all the others that belong to the Foundation's universe, perpetuate this tradition at their graduation courses in administration and economy, as well as post-graduation courses such as in Social Sciences and Law.\r\n\r\nIts schools, in various regions of the country, are recognized also abroad, maintaining joint programs with important institutions, as well as advanced teaching centers. FGV's masters and doctor's degree programs accredit their students to be accepted as scholars or professors in the most demanding universities in the world. The lato sensu courses at FGV encompass a broad selection of programs, aimed at professionals searching for specialization and academic improvement, who benefit largely from the approval by the market.\r\n\r\nIts main areas of work and Schools are:\r\nEBAPE - Brazilian School of Public and Business Administration - 1952\r\nEAESP - Sao Paulo Business School - 1954\r\nEPGE - Post-Graduation School in Economics - 1960\r\nFGV PROJETOS - Consulting - 1970\r\nCPDOC - Center for Research and Contemporary Historical Documentation of Brazil - 1973\r\nFGV PRESS - 1974\r\nDIREITO RIO - Rio de Janeiro Law School - 2002\r\nEDESP - Sao Paulo Law School - 2002\r\nEESP - Sao Paulo School of Economics - 2003\r\nIDE - Educational Development Institute - 2003\r\n\tFGV Management - develops, implements and manages distribution of MBA courses through a network of affiliates in 80 cities around Brazil\r\n\tFGV Online - Distance Education\r\n\tCorporative Courses - in-company courses for executives development\r\n\tCertification  - Quality assurance for undergraduate programs\r\n\r\nFGV Online \r\nThe flexibility of time and place is one of the most important advantages of the online courses offered by FGV, neutralizing barriers such as time and distance. But there are other advantages, such as the development of self established timing compatible with each student's needs, the employment of a case method system, focused in the Brazilian reality, as well as the easy access to the knowledge resources schools and other units at FGV and the reductions of costs and efficiency gains.\r\n\r\nThe FGV professors elaborate the content of the courses, in several areas. The most relevant concepts of the program are supported by audiovisual content, animations and games. The use of different multimedia resources optimizes the interactions between the student and the professor, contributing to the knowledge building process.\r\n\r\nRecently, two courses of FGV Online were awarded by EFMD \u2013 the European Foundation for Management Development  - with CEL, the Programme accreditation for Technology-Enhanced Learning: Executive Master in Business Administration and the Undergraduate Course in Process Management." .
